# Illustrated Machine Learning

To do:

- [ ] Define index (structure & components)
- [Â ] Define contacts (structure & components)
- [ ] Define "page" organization. Should we use one single page to which we change the png ref?
- [x] Fix the dropdown menu for inner pages 
- [ ] Generalize the markdown references. From pages/*.html it is not reachable -> add prefix? Or a full static link?
